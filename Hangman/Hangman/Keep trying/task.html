<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Let's make the game iterative. It's time to make it resemble the classical Hangman a bit more: a player should guess letters in the word instead of typing the entire word at once. If the player guesses a letter, it should be uncovered in the word. For now, start with the defeat case and add 8 tries to guess a letter that appears in the word. When the player runs out of attempts, the game ends.</p>

<p>Later we will determine the winning conditions, but in this stage, let's see how well our player guesses the word on every attempt.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Now your game should work the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A player has <strong>exactly 8 tries</strong> and enters letters. If a player has more tries but he actually guessed the word, it doesn't mean anything.</li>
	<li>If the letter doesn't occur in the word, the computer takes one try away, even if the user already inputted this letter before.</li>
	<li>If the player doesn't have any more attempts, the game should end and the program should show a losing message. Otherwise, the player can continue to input letters.</li>
	<li>Also, use our  previous word list: <code class="java">'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code> so that your program can be tested more reliably.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</div></p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N

----------
Input a letter: &gt; a

-a-a------
Input a letter: &gt; i

-a-a---i--
