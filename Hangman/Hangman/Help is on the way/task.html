<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now our game has become quite hard, and your chances of guessing the word depend on the size of the list. In our case with four words, there is only a 25% chance, so let's have mercy on the player and add a hint for them.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>As in the previous stage, you should use the following word list: <code class="java">'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code></li>
	<li>Show the <strong>first 3 letters</strong> after the computer chose a word from the list. Hidden letters should be replaced with hyphens (<code class="java">"-"</code>).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word jav-: &gt; java
You survived!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word pyt---: &gt; pythia
You are hanged!</code></pre>
