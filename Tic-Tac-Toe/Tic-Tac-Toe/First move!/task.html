<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>In addition to analyzing the field, it is equally important to add the ability to select a cell for your move. Now you need to implement human moves. Let's divide the field into cells.</p>

<p>Suppose the bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:<br>
<br>
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)<br>
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)<br>
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)</p>

<p>The program should ask to enter the coordinates where the user wants to make a move.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that in this stage user moves as X, not O. Keep in mind that the first coordinate goes from left to right and the second coordinate goes from bottom to top. Also, notice that coordinates start with 1 and can be 1, 2 or 3.</p>

<p>But what if the user enters incorrect coordinates? The user could enter symbols instead of numbers or enter coordinates representing occupied cells. You need to prevent all of that by checking a user's input and catching possible exceptions.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>The program should work in the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get the 3x3 field from the input as in the previous stages.</li>
	<li>Output this 3x3 field with cells before the user's move.</li>
	<li>Then ask the user about his next move.</li>
	<li>Then the user should input 2 numbers that represent the cell on which user wants to make his X or O. (9 symbols representing the field would be on the first line and these 2 numbers would be on the second line of the user input)</li>
	<li>Analyze user input and show messages in the following situations:<br>
	-<code class="java">"This cell is occupied! Choose another one!"</code> - if the cell is not empty;<br>
	-<code class="java">"You should enter numbers!"</code> - if the user enters other symbols;<br>
	-<code class="java">"Coordinates should be from 1 to 3!"</code> - if the user goes beyond the field.</li>
	<li>Then output the table including the user's most recent move.</li>
</ol>

<p>The program should also check user input. If the user input is unsuitable, the program should ask him to enter coordinates again. </p>

<p>So, you need to output a field from the first line of the input and then ask the user to enter a move. Keep asking until the user enters coordinate that represents an empty cell on the field and after that output the field with that move. You should output the field only 2 times - before the move and after a legal move.</p>

<p><em>Do not delete code</em> that checks for table state; it will be useful in the future.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The examples below shows how your program should work. <br>
The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>
