<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Every browser accepts a string from the user and then shows a web page. A string from the user is a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and looks somewhat like this: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com</a>. After that, the browser has a lot of work. In a nutshell, this work can be described as finding a web page. The web page is located somewhere on the Internet and the browser has to retrieve it. Since the <code class="java">https://www.</code> part is always the same, it is often omitted and the correct shortened link looks like this: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">google.com</a>.</p>

<p>In our first stage, we'll try to imitate this behavior.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>You should write a program that takes a string from the user (URL) and outputs a "hard-coded" website with news (just a header and some text below).<br>
	The websites are presented as two variables in source code, you can see them in the template. These are mock <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">bloomberg.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">nytimes.com</a> sites. You just need to output them as a response to the corresponding input URL. </li>
	<li>
	<p>Also, you should add the possibility to quit the browser by typing <code class="java">exit</code>, because real browsers don’t finish their work when they output a single web page: they are ready to accept a new URL at any moment. You should realize this behavior, too. An endless loop can help you with that part.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

The Space Race: From Apollo 11 to Elon Musk

It's 50 years since the world was gripped by historic images
of Apollo 11, and Neil Armstrong -- the first man to walk
on the moon. It was the height of the Cold War, and the charts
were filled with David Bowie's Space Oddity, and Creedence's
Bad Moon Rising. The world is a very different place than
it was 5 decades ago. But how has the space race changed since
the summer of '69? (Source: Bloomberg)
