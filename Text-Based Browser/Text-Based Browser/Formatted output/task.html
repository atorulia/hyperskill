<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>It’s not enough to just drop the tags. You should make your output “readable”. After all, we would like to have a user-friendly browser, right? At this stage, try to make your browser look more like a browser.</p>

<p>Almost every page contains links. Have you ever wondered why blue was chosen to highlight them?</p>

<p>One of the reasons lies in the physiology of the human eye. Red and green are detected by the same cells in the eye, and one of the most common forms of colorblindness is red-green colorblindness. It affects 7% of men and only 0.4% of women, that’s still one person in 25 overall. But almost no one has a blue deficiency. Accordingly, nearly everyone can see blue, or, more accurately, almost everyone can distinguish blue as a color different from others.</p>

<p>Also, blue is the darkest color that does not reduce the readability of the text.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>Let all links in your browser be blue! Pay attention to the <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colorama</a> library. This library is already installed in the project, so you can use it. With this library, you can easily solve this task just after reading the documentation!</p>
