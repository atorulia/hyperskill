title: Text-Based Browser
language: English
summary: Sometimes you need to read online documentation or find something on the
  Internet from the command line or terminal. So, let's use Python to create a text-based
  browser! Of course, making a real, full-blown browser is a very difficult task.
  In this project, you'll create a very simple browser that will ignore JavaScript
  and CSS, won't have cookies, and will only process a limited set of tags. Still,
  it will be useful and, most importantly, fun to program!<br/><br/>Learn more at
