language: English
summary: The times of sitting down with a coffee and reading a newspaper seem to have
  passed. Now everyone gets news from their laptops or phones, so online news websites
  are very popular. These sites specialize on the collecting and sharing general news
  or materials on some specific topic. Some are independent projects, and others,
  like The New York Times, expanded from what wasn't initially made for the online
  world. What they all have in common is their basic structure. In this project, you
  will create a web application for online news with the help of Django.<br/><br/>Learn
